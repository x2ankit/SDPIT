                    <p class="opening">Dear Students,</p>
                    <p>Welcome to our organization. Before we start, let me introduce myself…. this is <strong>Sachin Kumar Sahu</strong>, act as the Director of the Company since the year, <strong>2021</strong>. On the other hand, this is not the beginning, its already started since the year <strong>2010</strong> and this is the tune up of all hard work, dedication and patience.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my view, Computer and learning computer are two major things today, am I right? If you answer is a big yes, then what is the exact way to learn such things. So, answer is to choose your good option first, before starting something new, marvelous and outstanding.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, in the present world computer is attached into our life like a family member and we cannot ignore the same. All are bound to know the use of computer today. Without knowledge of computer you cannot accomplish your tasks because all things are related to computers.</p>
                    
                    <p>So, in my opinion choose the best platform which can help you understand what exactly computer is and why we should use the same to maintain our lifestyle. We have a dedicated team of faculties who are highly qualified and have rich working experiences with Corporate sectors, will share their techniques, ideas, thoughts and experience with students and will assist them to make their dream come true.</p>
                    
                    <p class="closing">We assure, that our students will definitely benefit studying with us and will achieve their dream objectives. We wish the best to all our students and surely, I personally, will always be available for our students to assist and help to ease out the way for their successful career and life.</p>
